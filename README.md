# Football match results prediction
My third Changellenge course project. 

The task was to build a model to forecast the results of football matches.
Based on the data that the model would give, I had to create a dashboard for any user that wanted to make a bet. 
Besides, data preprocessing was conducted in SQLite. 

The results you can see in this [Notebook](https://github.com/zhukvv/foolball_match_results_forcast/blob/main/football_match-results_model.ipynb).
